misc repo with things/tests that don't deserve their own repo yet

that's pretty much it! i love git, but sometimes I can't be bothered
with making a repo for every single thing I'd like to try out. In a way,
by always have a place ready for prototypes, I should feel less stressed in
trying something out just for the sake of it.
Hopefully this works!
